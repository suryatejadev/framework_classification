# framework_classification
This contains the source code for a Keras-based framework that can be used for any multi-class classification tasks. It includes the following: 
- Classification Models: ANN, SVM, random forest, decision trees. 
- Data Expansion Methods: Oversampling, [SMOTE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1813).
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the ROC curve, Positive and negative predictive values.  
- Visualization Methods: [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)
